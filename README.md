 The files hapmap3 r2 b36 chr15 CEU.haps and hapmap3 r2 b36 chr20 CEU.haps contain Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 500-kb regions of chromosomes 15 and 20, respectively, selected from phased haplotypes of 117 individuals with northwest European ancestry that were sampled as part of Phase 3 of the HapMap project (http://www.hapmap.org). The files hapmap3 r2 b36 chr15 PopX.haps and hapmap3 r2 b36 chr20 PopX.haps contain data at the same SNPs from 174 individuals with unknown ancestry. Within each file, rows represent SNPs in this region, and each column is a distinct haplotype, with every two consecutive columns representing the DNA from a single diploid individual. The two possible allele types at each SNP are coded as {0,1}. 
###  -Task (1-a): For each of chromosomes 15 and 20, infer the mutation rate for each of populations CEU and PopX 
###  -Task (1-b): Separately for each of chromosomes 15 and 20, and for each population CEU and PopX,plot the distribution of p-values when testing each SNP for Hardy- Weinburg-Equilibrium. 
###  -Task (1-c): Separately within each chromosome and each population, explore linkage dis- equilibrium (LD) among all pairs of SNPs using                both r2 and |D′|. Also, for each population, calculate r2 and |D′| between all pairs of SNPs on different chromosomes (i.e.                one SNP on chromosome 15, the other on chromosome 20)
